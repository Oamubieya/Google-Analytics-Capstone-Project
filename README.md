# Google-Analytics-Capstone-Project

This repository contains an analysis completed for the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Certificate course.

In this case study I used the data from a fictional bike rental company, Cyclistic, to try and determine the main differences between annual members and casual rider.  I will showcase he full process of cleaning, analyzing and visualizing the data, along with my final suggestions and summary of the data.

##The Data
To analyze Cyclystics historical trip data I used the previous 12 months of Cyclystic trip data pulled from [divvy trip database](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
